# Artemis-Secure-Software-Journal
Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report Journal


The client for this project was Artemis Financial, a financial service company. The company wanted help strengthening the security of their software. I completed this by refactoring their existing application and adding encryption and secure communications.

I added SHA-256 hasing to the code and secured communication with SSL/TLS, which protects both the data and the users. It's extremely important to code securely because vulnerabilities can lead to huge losses like data leaks, system failures, and legal issues. Software security is one of the most important things for a company's well being, as it adds trust and protection for the company and the users.

I think the dependency check was extremely helpful because it flagged known issues with the libraries, and luckily I had no issues present, it was a good reassurance. I think getting the tools up and running properly was extremely challenging, as it's finnicky and it took a lot of trial and error/patience. 

I increased security by adding SHA-256 hashing and setting up SSL/TLS. The dependency check report and certificate for HTTPS really helped me go the extra mile in adding security as well.

I tested the code and software application for functionality by running the Spring Boot app and making sure the console gave the correct output. In order to check the security of the code I used the dependency check report to confirm that there were no vulnerabilties. 

All of the tools used were definitely helpful to some degree, I think the OWASP Dependency-Check tool was probably my favorite. Having the peace of mind of no new vulnerabilities was very relieving and had me comfortable enough to submit the project. As far as coding practices go, I tried my best to stick to the industry standard best practices.

I would show future employers that I was able to successfully refactor code to add hashing, set up secure HTTPS, and confirmed it was both functional through the output and secure through OWASP. It shows I was able to make the project work while also keeping things secure.
